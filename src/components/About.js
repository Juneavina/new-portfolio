              Hi, my name is June Avina and I am a passionate, creative React Native
              Developer. One of my favorite philosophies is "Progress is progress,
              just don't get lost in the process." With that in mind no matter
              what I take on, this philosophy helps me keep going when I am
              feeling low. Some traits that describe me are dedicated,
              committed and loyal. Once I set my mind to do something I go all
              in. I have been learning mobile app development for a year now, and web development for 2 years with
              Javascript and React becoming my new passions. The combination of
              creativity, logic, technology and the challenge of learning new
              things fuels my passion for mobile app development. Aside from coding, in
              my free time I enjoy go-karting, gaming, and watching movies.
